        The goal of this project is to design an e-commerce site.

The functionalities of the site are the following:

- create an account or login 
- make purchases on the site
- subscribe to the newsletter and get a discount code
- possibility to pay with paypal or credit card. It is a demo site, so I will put all products at 0 euro or 1 euro no matter how much you buy (in order to pay the service fees).
- possibility to contact me via a form to fill

Other features could be added as the project progresses.



The technologies I will use for this project:

- backend : Node.js, Express.js, mongodb/mongoose
- frontend: React.js, React hook, React components, React props, jsx, css, html, bootstrap, Material-UI (maybe)
- vs code as editor

I'll do some 'git push' as I go along on my project. 
So don't hesitate to come and have a look from time to time to see my progress.
Once the project is done, the site will be live so that you could see the final result.
